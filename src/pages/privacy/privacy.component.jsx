      Technology and new marketing practices have increased the amount of
      customer information collected and shared in today’s marketplace.
      Consumers are concerned about the impact this development has or might
      have on their privacy and reputation. At Magaya Corp., we are sensitive to
      the importance of these concerns. We want to serve consumers as
      effectively and conveniently as possible, and such service involves making
      use of technology and customer information. But we also want our customers
      to be confident that their relationship with Magaya Corp. is treated with
      the appropriate confidentiality. We therefore commit to customers that we
      will take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of the information
      shared with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recognize your right to privacy at Magaya Corp. Thus, we recognize that
      you have a right to expect that your personal information will remain
      private and secure. We will maintain standards to ensure that any
      information that is requested by us is held private and secure at all
      times. The same standards apply regardless of whether you are a current or
      former customer of Magaya Corp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information about you may be accumulated from a variety of sources. For
      example, we may collect nonpublic personal information about you from:
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these pieces of information will be referred to collectively
      throughout this policy as “Customer Information.” We will limit the use
      and collection of Customer Information to that which is necessary to
      administer our business, provide superior service to you, and to offer
      opportunities that we think will be of interest to you. This also means
      that we will use the Customer Information to help us identify and mitigate
      potential risks or loss to Magaya Corp. which ultimately benefits you. Of
      course, we will use this information only in accordance with the
      principles set out in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are times when we are required to disclose your Customer
      Information, while at other times we may voluntarily provide your Customer
      Information to carefully screened third parties in order to provide you
      with the high quality services that you have come to expect from Magaya
      Corp. In any event, we will always carefully control the way in which any
      Customer Information is shared. For example, we must disclose your
      Customer Information if ordered to do so by court order. On the other
      hand, we may disclose such information: To certain providers with which
      Magaya Corp. has an ongoing relationship, like a joint marketing
      agreement; or To companies that participate with Magaya Corp. in supplying
      products and services to customers; or To companies that promote products
      and services on our behalf; or To other companies and individuals who
      perform functions on our behalf. Functions may include fulfilling orders,
      delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive
      information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing
      assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer
      service; or To certain business transferees. As we continue to develop our
      business, we might sell or buy businesses, portions of businesses, or
      assets. In such transactions, Customer Information generally is one of the
      transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Magaya Corp.
      or substantially all of its assets are acquired, Customer Information will
      of course be one of the transferred assets; or To enforce or apply our
      Terms and Conditions of Website Use Agreement and other agreements; or
      protect the rights, property, or safety of Magaya Corp., our customers, or
      others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and
      organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction; or With your
      consent. Other than as set forth above, you will receive notice when
      information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an
      opportunity to choose not to share the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magaya Corp. does not sell products for purchase by children. We do not
      knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to
      children. We recognize that protecting children’s identities and privacy
      online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both
      the online industry and with parents. The only situation in which Magaya
      Corp. might collect personal information from a child would be if a child
      includes the information in a question he or she submits to us—which we
      ask children not to do. If Magaya Corp. receives such information, we
      delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any
      purpose. We also do not disclose it to third parties. Count on our
      Commitment to your Privacy You can count on us to keep you informed about
      how we protect your privacy and limit the sharing of information you
      provide to us. Our use of Customer Information is subject to the Privacy
      Policy in effect at the time of use of the Customer Information. If you
      choose to visit the websites of Magaya Corp., your visit and any dispute
      over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and the Terms and
      Conditions of Website Use Agreement, including, but not limited to,
      limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the
      law of the state of Florida. If for some reason you believe Magaya Corp.
      has not adhered to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy, please
      notify us at info@magaya.com and we will do our best to determine and
      correct the problem promptly. Be certain to insert the words Privacy
